<p>
<b>Goal:</b>
JUnit, Abstraction Function, and Rep-Invariants</p>
<ol>
<li> First you need to learn how to write JUnit tests, so that you can run them on the command line or within an IDE. You are provided with skeleton helper files.
</li><li> Devise and implement a sensible rep-invariant "boolean repOK()" and abstraction function for class Stack (attached). Recall that in Java the AF is implemented as the "String toString()" method. Make sure to read the specs of the methods in the Stack class, before defining the rep-invariant. 
</li><li>After implementing repOk() and toString(), add tests to StackTester: a) at least 5 tests that will demonstrate that repOk() is satisfied. b) at least 5 tests demonstrating that toString() is properly implemented.
</li><li>Create a duplicate of class Stack, called StackBuggy. Inject a bug in StackBuggy, e.g., delete a statement or change/add an operator etc. Your injected bug should violate the rep-invariant.
Add comments in StackBuggy identifying your injected bug.
</li><li>Write one or more tests in StackBuggyTester that will exercise your injected bug and violate repOk().
</li></ol>
